I have setup a distribution list for the group, please check to see if you identify anyone who is missing from your knowledge in the distribution (To) line.

I have enabled (with the help of Kyle) the notification from github to the Slack Channel.  This should provide an update when any push events occur to the repository and is supposed to provide notifications of discussion thread updates to allow their use (I have not tested that aspect yet)

Actions:

- Add guidelines for the development/spec creation for the contributions to the repo.

Upcoming Meeting Topics

- DPDK Interface Walk through (next week 4/7/2022) – Jerin Jacob Kollanukkaran (Marvell)
